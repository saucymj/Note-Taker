# Note-Taker

## Description

I created this app so that users will be able to take important notes. They have the ability to save and revist past notes, while also being able to delete the notes as well. This will allow them to be effective and organized in their respective work places. When entering a note users can pick a unique name that will be visible to them at all times and then add the text to go with that specific note title. 

## Installation

To install this app users will first have to run npm init and npm install in their terminals for backend access. They then would have to run node server.js to have the app start running and they will be able to have access to the app.

## Usage

This app can be used to take notes in the workplace or even just for everyday casual notes.
